# dijkstras_alg_on_weighted_digraph
Contains a class with a function that finds the shortest path between two points using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Also contains functions that add edges to the graph, gets the weight of a path, determines if a path exists, and determines if a path is valid. Though no functions return the weight of the minimum path, it could be easily modified to do so.

NOTES: Requires a .h file, which is not included.
